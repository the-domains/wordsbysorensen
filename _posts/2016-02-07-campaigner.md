### The Alma Motto  
Slogans

Anticipation.  
Biting your lip, waiting for your opportunity.  
There's the handshake, the smiles, the obligatory introductions.  
That all important question just rolling off the tongue,  
Coming at you with both barrels blazing:  
"What's _your_ business all about?"

He
swirls his cognac in the glass, the light catching its amber hue. He's 
daring you to tell him something he's never heard before, and trust me -
he's heard it all. You can tell from that knowing look in his eye as he
tries to size you up...

Are you **_dangerous_** to the empire he's built, brick by brick?

It's the moment you've been waiting for.  
To stop him in his tracks, begging to invest,  
Succumbing to a handful of devilishly charming words.  
You take a sip of your cabernet, "Funny you should ask."

Oh, how the tables have turned.

It doesn't take gold or arms to conquer new territory in the digital age.   
Today, the world can be yours for the cost of a Squarespace membership.   
Start when you want. Sell what you want.   
Declare your autonomy across a global stage,   
All from the comfort of home. 

No scurvy. No bloodshed. No hassle. 

Yet, beneath this guise of simplicity, we've become complacent.   
Using the same words in the same ways,   
Relying on algorithms and artificial intelligence  
Rather than empathy or collaboration. 

But a digital revolution is on the horizon,  
And it starts with our resistance:

Against monotonous, self-indulgent websites.  
Against winding paragraphs that lead to nowhere.  
And against the fake, the disingenuous and the downright lame.  
Because it's not enough to "break" the internet.  
Together, we can win it.

Some words seem to have magical properties.  
It isn't necessarily grammar, form or function.  
Just a certain 'je ne sais quoi' that leaves you intrigued.

Words that have been studied, reworked and refined,  
Balanced in the pursuit of reaction.  
Using an ancient art that's more chemistry than magic.

Bold and captivating. Elegant and powerful.  
Your base, our science.  
Words transformed into solid gold.

### The Phantom Scribe

You know how to write.   
We've all been through school.   
We've all done book reports and research papers.   
Been there, done that. Moving on. 

But sometimes, you don't have to grin and bear it.   
You don't need to "knock it out."   
Or face your fears of the blank page.   
You don't need to drudge up old APA handbooks,   
Or read another article on content marketing best practices. 

There is **_another_** option. 

Summon the Phantom Scribe,  
When the need arises for work that's both remarkable and enchanting...  
When you desire something that's elevated and bursting with life...   
When technical writing simply won't suffice...  
**Or, when you just need a damn break.**  
Because you _don't_ have to do it all.   
Sometimes you can get help from the other side.

_Includes
phone consults with the living, research, brainstorming and 500 words 
for $500\. Great for sales tools, blog posts, eBooks, bios and more._
